# qb_fnc_arma3

Miscellaneous scripts to help small co-op mission design in Arma 3

## Purpose

These scripts are a collection of rather random scripts intended to help design of (small) co-op missions for Arma 3. They are designed to work on hosted multiplayer and on dedicated servers.

## Usage

Place script files in a directory named `qb` in your mission folder. Compile functions as needed, or call `qb/qb_init.sqf` to compile all of them at once. Call the scripts from the server, not clients.

## Work in progress

Scripts are work in progress and may or may not work fully or not at all. Any constructive feedback as well as contributions of new scripts or contributions to the existing scripts are welcome.
